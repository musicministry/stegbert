## Mass Parts

The parts of the Mass for Advent will be taken from *Missa Emmanual* by Richard Proulx (note that the Gloria is omitted during Advent). They are all based on the familiar tune VENI EMMANUEL of the well-known hymn *O Come, O Come, Emmanual* and can be found in the hymnal:

#### Holy, Holy, Holy
